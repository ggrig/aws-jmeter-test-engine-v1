The end goal of the overall full solution is visioned to look like this:

In order to utilize full automated framework, there needs to be ready load generator AMI image with required software and tuning. The image then used together with CloudFormation to start needed number of EC2 Instances. 


## How to setup the Load Generator?

Note: These instructions are based on Ubuntu 20.04.

The following needs to be in place by default in Load Generator image:

- Install useful applications
- Java version 8
- JMeter  
- ICAP Client
- Linux tuning & install useful applications

# Install useful applications

```bash
sudo apt -y install telnet
sudo apt -y install jq 
sudo apt -y install unzip
```
# Setup Java 8 

```bash
  sudo apt -y install openjdk-8-jdk
```
Check java version with "java -version" command. 
If Java version is not 8 then:

```bash
sudo alternatives --config java
```
Simply enter the a selection number to choose which java executable should be used by default.
```bash
There are 2 programs which provide 'java'.

  Selection    Command
-----------------------------------------------
*  1           /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.7.0-openjdk.x86_64/bin/java
 + 2           /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64/bin/java
```
enter 2.
Confirm that Java version is 8.

```bash
java -version
```
Output looks like this:
```bash
[ec2-user@ip-10-112-4-96 ~]$ java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_265"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_265-b01)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.265-b01, mixed mode)
```
# Setup Jmeter and necessary folders

```bash
sudo mkdir /home/ec2-user
cd /home/ec2-user/
sudo sudo wget https://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/mirrors/apache.org//jmeter/binaries/apache-jmeter-5.3.zip
unzip apache-meter-5.3.zip
```
create necessary in and out folders:
```bash
sudo mkdir /home/ec2-user/apache-jmeter-5.3/bin/in
sudo mkdir /home/ec2-user/apache-jmeter-5.3/bin/out
```

# Setup ICAP Client

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install c-icap -y
```
ICAP Client is installed in /usr/bin/c-icap-client this folder.

# Linux tuning & install useful applications

Ulimit tuning.

In order to be able to generate high traffic, there is a need to tune Linux ulimit parameters:

sudo nano /etc/security/limits.conf
 Edit the following file
 ```bash
 sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
```
Add & save:
```bash
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 12000 65535
fs.file-max = 1048576
```
Edit the following file:
 ```bash
sudo nano /etc/security/limits.conf
```
Add & Save:
```bash
*           soft      nofile     1048576
*           hard      nofile     1048576
root        soft      nofile     1048576
root        hard      nofile     1048576
```

Reboot & Confirm that changes are in effect:
```bash
[root@ip-10-112-4-96 ec2-user]# ulimit -n
1048576
```
